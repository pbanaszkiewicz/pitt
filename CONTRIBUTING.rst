If you are proposing a feature:

* Explain in detail how it would work.

* Remember that all contributions are welcome :)

Fix bugs
~~~~~~~~

Look through the
`GitHub issues <https://github.com/pbanaszkiewicz/pitt/issues>`_ for bugs.
Anything tagged with "bug" is open to whoever wants to implement it.

The easiest way to start contributing is either fix bugs / implement features
tagged with "easy" or write and fix documentation.

Implement features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Look through the GitHub issues for enhancements. Anything tagged with
"enhancement" is open to whoever wants to implement it.

Write documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`Pitt <https://github.com/pbanaszkiewicz/pitt>`_ could always use more
documentation, whether as part of the official Pitt docs, in docstrings, or
even on the web in blog posts, articles, and such.

Get Started!
------------

Ready to contribute? Here's how to set up `Pitt`_ for local development.

1. Fork the `Pitt`_ repo on GitHub.
2. Clone your fork locally::

    $ git clone git@github.com:your_name_here/pitt.git

3. Create a branch for local development::

    $ git checkout -b name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature

   Now you can make your changes locally.

4. Commit your changes and push your branch to GitHub::

    $ git add .
    $ git commit -m "Your detailed description of your changes."
    $ git push origin name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature

5. Submit a pull request through the GitHub website.

Pull Request Guidelines
-----------------------

Before you submit a pull request, check that it meets these guidelines:

1. If the pull request adds functionality, the docs should be updated. Put
   your new functionality into a function with a docstring, and add the
   feature to the list in ``README.rst``.
2. If there are tests in the application, you should add tests for your new
   functionality.
